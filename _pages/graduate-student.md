<td>Review scholarship opportunities through your program website (ex: College of Education, College of Business, etc.) and follow directions to apply for scholarships.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>April</strong></td>
<td>While there is no FAFSA deadline for graduate students, we encourage students to submit early, so that the student bill will be paid by the billing deadline.</td>

<td><strong>Early August</strong></td>
<td>If your financial aid exceeds your student bill, consider completing a Bookstore Voucher, which allows you to use a portion of your refund in the UMW Bookstore!</td>
