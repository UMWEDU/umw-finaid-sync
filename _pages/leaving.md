What happens to your financial aid after you leave the University? Depending on the specific situation, it is possible that a portion of your aid may be returned to the lender, and/or you may need to begin repayment on any Federal or Private Student Loans.  In the case of a mid-semester withdrawal, please see the UMW <a href="http://www.umw.edu/financialaid/leaving/return-of-funds/">Return of Funds for Withdrawal Policy</a> to determine the amount that may need to be returned to Federal loan and grant programs. Before a you graduate, regulations require that you complete <a href="http://www.umw.edu/financialaid/types/loans/exit-counseling/">exit counseling</a> for your Federal Loans.
