<h2>Withdrawal</h2>
Official withdrawals from academic courses occur through the UMW Office of the Registrar. Withdrawing from all courses in a semester will affect the amount of aid that students may be eligible for during that semester. As a result, it is possible that financial aid packages may be changed after the withdrawal date is known, which could result in a balance on the student’s University account.

If you are planning to withdraw from all courses in a semester, please contact Rhonda Stills, Office of the Registrar, at (540)654-1259 or <a href="mailto:rstills@umw.edu">rstills@umw.edu</a>  for <a href="http://academics.umw.edu/registrar/ferpa-policies-procedures-services/withdrawal-procedures/">full withdrawal procedures</a>.
<h2>Private Educational Student Loans</h2>
The policies regarding withdrawal mid-semester are determined by each private loan lender. UMW will contact the lender when the official withdrawal date is known for determination of how to proceed with the loan funds.
<h2>Federal Direct Student Loans</h2>
<h3>Direct Loan Exit Counseling</h3>
<a href="http://www.umw.edu/financialaid/types/loans/exit-counseling/">Federal Loan Exit Counseling</a> is required by the Federal regulation for all students that withdraw, graduate, or drop below half-time enrollment. It helps student’s understand their rights and responsibilities as a student loan borrower, and provides helpful tips to help students manage their loan repayment.
<h3>Return of Federal Funds</h3>
Per <a href="http://www.umw.edu/financialaid/process/leaving/return-of-funds/treatment-of-title-iv-federal-aid-when-a-student-withdraws/">federal regulation</a>, UMW is required to calculate the amount of federal funds that must be returned to the loan lender (U.S. Department of Education). This <a href="http://www.umw.edu/financialaid/leaving/return-of-funds/">Return to Title 4 (R2T4)</a> calculation is based on the amount of days that the student was enrolled in the semester, as well as the students earned institutional charges.
<h3>Grace Periods</h3>
In most cases, the grace period of a federal student loan is six months. This means that repayment will not begin until six months after graduation. One exception is the Federal Perkins Loan, which has a nine month grace period.  During the grace period, it is important to contact your federal loan servicer to choose the payment plan that fits your needs best.
<h3>Loan Lender v. Loan Servicer</h3>
The loan lender is the organization that initially made the loan. For Federal student loans, the loan lender is the U.S. Department of Education. The loan servicer is the "middleman." They will collect payments, respond to customer service inquiries, and perform other administrative tasks associated with maintaining a federal loan. The loan servicer agency can be viewed by students by logging into the National Student Loan Database (NSLDS).
<h3>Repayment Plans</h3>
If a student does not contact their loan servicer prior to the end of the grace period, they will automatically be enrolled in the 10-year Standard Repayment Plan. However, there are a variety of other plans that may suit the student’s individual financial status better, including several <a href="https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/understand/plans">Income-Based repayment plan options</a>.
<h2>Return of State Funds</h2>
The return of funds to state grants (Virginia Guaranteed Assistance Grant, Virginia Commonwealth Grant) is also based on the federal R2T4 calculation.
<h2>Return of UMW Merit Based Scholarships and Endowed Scholarship Funds</h2>
Return of these funds is determined by program guidelines or individual circumstances.
