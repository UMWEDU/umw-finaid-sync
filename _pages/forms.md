<em><strong>Verification Forms</strong></em>

Students selected for verification are required to complete a verification form, along with other types of requested documentation. There are several different types of verification (V1, V4, V5). Each verification type has different requirements based on students’ unique situations. Students are only selected for one type of Verification (V1, V4, V5) and therefore only need to complete one corresponding Verification Worksheet.
