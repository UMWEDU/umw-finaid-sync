<h2>Federal Grant Opportunities</h2>
<h3>Federal Pell Grant</h3>
The Federal Pell Grant is automatically awarded to undergraduate students that meet all qualifications. Students must complete the FAFSA and demonstrate a specific level of financial need. This level changes each academic year.

The amount of the Federal Pell Grant also changes each year, as determined by the U.S. Department of Education. Amounts are based on a studentâ€™s financial need, institutional estimated cost of attendance, and enrollment status. Students may receive the Federal Pell Grant at one institution per semester, and cannot receive the grant more than 12 semesters.
<h3>Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG)</h3>
The FSEOG grant is awarded to undergraduate students with exceptional financial need, as determined by the FAFSA. Students that complete the FAFSA, and meet all other qualifications, are automatically awarded.
