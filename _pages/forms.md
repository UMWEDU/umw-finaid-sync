<em><strong>2017-2018 Verification Forms</strong></em>

Students selected for verification are required to complete a verification form, along with other types of requested documentation. There are several different types of verification (V1, V4, V5). Each verification type has different requirements based on students’ unique situations. Students are only selected for one type of Verification (V1, V4, V5) and therefore only need to complete one corresponding Verification Worksheet.

Some types of documentation that may be required for the 2017-2018 academic year are:
<ul>

 	<li><a href="http://www.umw.edu/financialaid/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2016/03/2017-2018Verification-Form-V4.pdf">V4 Verification Worksheet</a></li>
 	<li><a href="http://www.umw.edu/financialaid/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2016/03/2017-2018Verification-Form-V5.pdf">V5 Verification Worksheet</a></li>
</ul>
For the 2017-2018 year, all students/parents will be required by federal regulation to submit all W2's or other wage statements. Students and/or parents that did not file a 2015 tax return are required to submit a Verification of Non-Filing letter, which can be ordered free of charge through www.irs.gov, or by completing an IRS  form 4506-T ( <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f4506t.pdf">https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f4506t.pdf</a>  ).

A list of each student's specific financial aid requirements can be viewed at any time through the student myUMW portal by accessing the <a href="https://orgsync.com/82489/chapter">Eagle Gateway</a>.
