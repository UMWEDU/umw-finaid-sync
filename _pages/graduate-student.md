As a student in a UMW Graduate Program, you may be eligible for the Federal Direct Loan Program, as well as various Departmental scholarships.
<h2>Important dates and deadlines:</h2>
<h3>Prior to January 1</h3>
Students, and parents of dependent students: Apply for a Federal Student Aid ID, so that you can complete your <a href="https://fafsa.ed.gov/">FAFSA</a> after January 1.
<h3>January 1</h3>
<a href="https://fafsa.ed.gov/">FAFSA</a> available!
<h3>February 1</h3>
Review scholarship opportunities through your Program website (ex: School of Education, School of Business, etc.) and follow directions to apply for scholarships.
<h3>April</h3>
While there is no FAFSA deadline for Graduate students, we encourage students to submit early, so that the student bill will be paid by the billing deadline.
<h3>Early August</h3>
If your financial aid exceeds your student bill, consider completing a <a href="http://www.umw.edu/financialaid/eligibility/bookstore-voucher/">Bookstore Voucher</a>, which allows you to use a portion of your refund in the UMW Bookstore!
