Before a student withdraws, graduates, or drops below half-time attendance (regardless if you plan to transfer to another school), regulations require that you complete an exit counseling session for your Federal Stafford Loan (subsidized or unsubsidized) and Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans. The counseling session provides information about how to manage your student loans after college.

Loan Exit Counseling is located on the <a href="http://www.studentloans.gov">Department of Educationâ€™s website</a>.
