Below you will find frequently asked questions for the upcoming academic year. This FAQ addresses questions about the basic Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), verification process and deadlines, as well as additional PLUS loan, private loan and scholarship information. Please contact the Office of Financial Aid at 540-654-2468 or <a href="mailto:finaid@umw.edu">finaid@umw.edu</a> if you need more information.
<h2>How do I apply for financial aid?</h2>
Complete the 2018-2019 or 2019-2020 <a href="http://FAFSA.ed.gov">Free Application for Federal Student Aid</a>. The Office of Financial Aid will then contact you through mail (first-time students) or email (continuing students) regarding any additional requirements that are needed. Requirements can also be viewed through myUMW <a href="https://banner.umw.edu/ssomanager/c/SSB">Banner</a>.
<h2>When do I apply for financial aid?</h2>
In order to be considered for federal, state, and institutional financial aid, you must file the FAFSA by:
<ul>
 	<li>February 1 - Incoming Freshman</li>
 	<li>April 1 - Incoming Transfers</li>
 	<li>February 1 - Continuing Students</li>
</ul>
If you submit the FAFSA after these dates, you may only be considered for the Direct Loan Program and the Federal Pell Grant.
<h2>What happens after I file the FAFSA?</h2>
If you are an incoming freshman applicant, you will receive an award letter at the address listed on your FAFSA.  We will start sending award letters after January 1st.  This award letter provides the following:
<ul>
 	<li>Overview of your information based on FAFSA results in the top right corner.</li>
 	<li>Breakdown of your financial aid offers in the body of the award letter.</li>
 	<li>If you are selected for verification, a list of documents that must be submitted to the Office of Financial Aid by July 1 at the bottom of the letter.</li>
</ul>
*Late paperwork may result in cancelled aid.

Continuing students will receive notices of their verification requirements via <a href="https://banner.umw.edu/ssomanager/c/SSB">Banner</a> and their UMW email account. Verification paperwork is due July 1. Continuing students will be able to view their financial aid award through <a href="https://banner.umw.edu/ssomanager/c/SSB">Banner</a> in May.
<h2>Is the financial aid application process different for graduate students?</h2>
Graduate students must also file the FAFSA in order to be considered for federal aid. Graduate students are only eligible for the Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan. Gift aid typically comes from departmental scholarships.
<h2>When will I hear about merit scholarships?</h2>
The Office of Admissions notifies students of merit scholarship awards with the admission offer. UMW Foundation Scholarships are determined in June and added to student financial aid packages at that time.
<h2>Are there any other scholarships available?</h2>
For consideration of UMW Foundation Scholarships, submit the scholarship application (available through the UMW <a href="http://umw.scholarships.ngwebsolutions.com/">Online Scholarship Manager</a>) by May 15. The scholarships available through this application are both merit- and need-based. All need-based scholarships require financial need demonstrated through the FAFSA. If you have declared your major, you can also check your department’s website for information about departmental scholarships.
<h2>How do I apply for a job on campus?</h2>
Students may complete the <a href="http://www.umw.edu/financialaid/student-employment/applicants/apply/">job application</a> at any time.
<h2>What are the costs for tuition, fees, room and board?</h2>
Actual costs are determined in late April when the Board of Visitors meets. Once the costs are known, you will receive that information in the mail. Current costs can be found by contacting the <a href="http://adminfinance.umw.edu/studentaccounts/">Office of Student Accounts</a>.
<h2>How do I apply for a student or parent loan?</h2>
Students are considered for federal loans when they apply for federal student aid via the FAFSA. In order to accept federal Direct Loans, students must complete the <a href="http://www.studentloans.gov/">Direct Loan Entrance Counseling and Master Promissory Note</a>. Students must also accept/decline all loan offers in their <a href="https://banner.umw.edu/ssomanager/c/SSB?pkg=twbkwbis.P_GenMenu?name=bmenu.P_FAApplStuMnu">Student Portal</a>.

A <a href="http://www.umw.edu/financialaid/types/loans/parent-plus-loan/">Parent Plus Loan</a> is an educational loan that a parent may use on behalf of their dependent student. This is a credit-based loan. Parents may apply for the <a href="http://www.studentloans.gov">PLUS Loan</a> after June 1 each year at <a href="https://studentloans.gov/myDirectLoan/index.action">StudentLoans.gov</a>.

Students may also apply for <a href="http://www.umw.edu/financialaid/types/loans/private/">private educational loans</a>.
<h2>How do I request consideration for special circumstances?</h2>
Since funds are limited, all requests for additional aid must be made formally using the <a href="http://www.umw.edu/financialaid/process/verification/special-situations/">special circumstances instructions</a>.  If approved, the student may be eligible for a conversion of unsubsidized loans to subsidized loans, or a Federal Pell Grant.
<h2>When is my bill due and what other options are available?</h2>
The fall bill is usually due in late July. Payment plan information will be sent to students and parents during the spring semester of the previous academic year. Additional questions about payment plans and coordination of prepaid plans should be directed to the Office of Student Accounts at <a href="mailto:umwbills@umw.edu">umwbills@umw.edu</a> or 540-654-1250.
