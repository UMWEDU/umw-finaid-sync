Parents of dependent UMW student may apply for a Direct PLUS Loan to help cover the costs of their child’s educational expenses.   These loans are credit based and parents may borrow up to the cost of attendance minus any other aid and resources received.  The cost of attendance may be found on the upper corner of the student’s award letter, or on the student MyUMW portal.

Graduate and professional students may apply for PLUS Loans for their own educational expenses.  Students must complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) to apply.  Students must have received maximum Direct Unsubsidized Student Loans before they may receive a Federal Direct Graduate PLUS loan.
