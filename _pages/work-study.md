The Office of Financial Aid coordinates the University of Mary Washington Student Employment program, including Federal Work Study (FWS) and Institutional Work Study (IWS).

Out of the 650 students employed at UMW, 7% are funded by the federal government through the FWS program. Students who receive FWS will see their FWS awards included in their financial aid award packages in their Eagle Gateway. They are typically awarded 10 hours a week for 15 weeks per semester. Students who are compensated through the FWS program do not have their earnings calculated into the following year’s Expected Family Contribution (EFC) on FAFSA. FWS is awarded to students who demonstrate high financial need.

IWS wages are compensated by the departments for which students are working, and their potential wage earnings will not be reflected on their financial aid award packages. Supervisors are responsible for managing their departmental student wage budget and calculating the total permissible working hours for each student. Wages earned through the IWS program are calculated into the following year’s EFC.

Under both programs, the total working hours per week is generally 10 hours, a little more or a little less depending on the student’s availability and departmental needs. Students must be enrolled in at least 6 credit hours in order to be eligible for Work Study.  Under no circumstances should students compromise their academic performance for a job on campus.
