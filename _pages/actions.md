	<li>Click “Eagle Gateway” located on the left side of the screen.</li>
	<li>Under <em>Getting Started</em>, click on “My Financial Aid”</li>
	<li>Click “My Award Information”</li>
	<li>Click “Award by Aid Year” and select “2015-2016 Academic Year”. Submit.</li>
	<li>Click on “Award Overview”. Please review your award package before you make your decision to accept or decline your student loans.</li>
	<li>Click on the “Accept Award Offer” tab and use the drop box to accept/decline your federal loans. You may also choose to accept or decline a portion of your loans by entering the desired amount of the loan in the boxes.  Be sure to accept your subsidized loans first, as they do not accrue interest while enrolled.</li>
	<li>Once you have completed this step, please submit the page.</li>
</ul>
***Please note that if you are a first time borrower, you will also need to complete Direct Loan Entrance Counseling and a <a href="http://www.studentloans.gov">Direct Loan Master Promissory Note</a>.

Using this exciting new feature will be the only way to accept or decline all or a portion of offered student loans beginning with the Fall 2015 semester. Please contact the Office of Financial Aid at <a href="mailto:finaid@umw.edu">finaid@umw.edu</a> or (540) 654-2468, if you have any questions.
