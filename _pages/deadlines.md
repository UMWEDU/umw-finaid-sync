<h2>Financial Aid Dates and Deadlines</h2>
Submitting financial aid information before the published deadline will ensure that students receive the maximum amount of financial aid for which they are eligible.

Submitting items after the deadline may result in:
<ul>
	<li>Loss of eligibility for limited state grant funds</li>
	<li>Delay in processing leading to a billing late fee</li>
	<li>Delay in buying textbooks</li>
</ul>
If you are having trouble meeting these deadlines for any reason, please contact the Office of Financial Aid. Our staff will be happy to assist you and determine the best way to proceed with the financial aid process.
