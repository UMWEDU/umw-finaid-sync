<h2>Financial Aid &amp; Scholarship Information</h2>
The University of Mary Washington offers financial assistance to graduate students enrolled at least half-time in degree programs and pathway programs. Half-time enrollment for graduate students is five graduate level credit hours per semester. A combination of 8 and 16 week courses can be taken.
<h4><span style="color: #ab0303"><strong>Students enrolled in other non-degree certificate programs or enrolled less than half time, are only eligible for alternative loans.</strong></span></h4>

<h3>How and When to Apply</h3>
Students interested in applying for financial aid must file the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) at <a href="http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/">www.fafsa.ed.gov.</a> In order for results from the FAFSA to download into the UMW financial aid system, students must have applied for admission.

The Office of Financial Aid determines eligibility for financial assistance after a student's acceptance into a program. Awarding of financial aid for the Fall term begins in April and in November for the Spring term. <strong>                                                                  </strong>

If enrolling for summer courses<strong>, </strong>students must also submit the <a href="https://orgsync.com/115365/forms">Request for Summer Financial Aid form</a> (myUMW) to the Office of Financial Aid.

<h2>Federal TEACH Grant</h2>
Through the College Cost Reduction and Access Act of 2007, Congress created the Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grant Program that provides grants of up to $4,000 per year to students who are completing or plan to complete course work needed to begin a career in teaching.

As a condition for receiving a TEACH Grant:

You must complete the <a id="anch_145" href="https://studentloans.gov/myDirectLoan/launchTeach.action" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TEACH Grant counseling</a> that explains the terms and conditions of the TEACH Grant service obligation. You must complete counseling each year that you receive a TEACH Grant.

You must also sign a <em>TEACH Grant Agreement to Serve</em> in which you agree to (among other requirements) teach
<ul>
 	<li>in a high-need field;</li>
 	<li>at an elementary school, secondary school, or educational service agency that serves students from low-income families; and</li>
 	<li>for at least four complete academic years within eight years after completing (or ceasing enrollment in) the course of study for which you received the grant.</li>
</ul>
