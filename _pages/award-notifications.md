The Office of Financial Aid begins notifying incoming freshmen and transfer students of their estimated financial aid packages in early March.  The initial award packet is sent to the student’s home address. It includes the student’s estimated financial aid award (based on the results of the FAFSA), a list of required documentation/forms, and important instructions for accessing the student’s financial aid through MyUMW. If there is an adjustment to the initial award package, the student will receive notification through their UMW email account, instructing them to review the changes through MyUMW.

Continuing student financial aid packages are created in mid-to-late May, after the previous semester grades have been posted. Continuing students will receive an email notification to their UMW email account instructing them to review their award through their MyUMW portal.  Any adjustments to the initial award package will result in the student receiving notification through their UMW email account, instructing them to review the changes through MyUMW.
