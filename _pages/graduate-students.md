<h2>Financial Aid &amp; Scholarship Information</h2>
The University of Mary Washington offers financial assistance to graduate students enrolled at least half-time in degree programs and pathway programs. Half-time enrollment for graduate students is five graduate level credit hours per semester. A combination of 8 and 16 week courses can be taken.
<h4><span style="color: #910303"><strong>Students enrolled in other non-degree certificate programs or enrolled less than half time, are only eligible for alternative loans.</strong></span></h4>
<h2>Financial Aid</h2>
<h3>How and When to Apply</h3>
Students interested in applying for financial aid must file the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) at <a href="http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/">www.fafsa.ed.gov.</a> In order for results from the FAFSA to download into the UMW financial aid system, students must have applied for admission.

The Office of Financial Aid determines eligibility for financial assistance after a student's acceptance into a program. Awarding of financial aid for the Fall term begins in April and in November for the Spring term. <strong>                                                                  </strong>

If enrolling for summer courses<strong>, </strong>students must also submit the <a href="https://orgsync.com/115365/forms">Request for Summer Financial Aid form</a> (myUMW) to the Office of Financial Aid.

See the <a href="http://www.umw.edu/financialaid/process/timelines/graduate-student/">Graduate Student Financial Aid Timeline</a> for more information.
