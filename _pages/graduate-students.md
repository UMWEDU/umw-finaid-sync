The University of Mary Washington offers financial assistance to students enrolled at least half-time in degree programs and pathway programs. Half-time enrollment for graduate students is five graduate level credit hours per semester. These credits can be taken in a combination of 8 or 16 week courses.

Students enrolled in other non-degree certificate programs or enrolled less than half time, are only eligible for alternative loans.
<h2>How and When to Apply</h2>
Students interested in applying for financial aid must file the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) on -line at <a href="http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/">www.fafsa.ed.gov. </a>In order for results from the FAFSA to download into the UMW financial aid system, students must have applied for admission.

Once students are accepted into a degree program, the Office of Financial Aid determines eligibility for financial assistance. Awarding of financial aid for the Fall term begins in April and in November for the Spring term. <strong>                                                                  </strong>

If enrolling for summer courses<strong>, </strong>students must also submit the Request for Summer Financial Aid form to the Office of Financial Aid.

See the <a href="http://www.umw.edu/financialaid/process/timelines/graduate-student/">Graduate Student Financial Aid Timeline</a> for more information.
