<h2>Early Cancellation</h2>
Students are encouraged to provide at least two weeksâ€™ notice to their supervisors if they plan to resign before meeting the full term of their job assignment. When a student resigns, supervisors must complete a Notice of Cancellation and an employment evaluation with the student:

<a href="http://adminfinance.umw.edu/financialaid/files/2015/07/Notice-of-Cancellation-20150304.pdf">Notice of Cancellation Form</a>

<a href="http://adminfinance.umw.edu/financialaid/files/2015/10/2015-2016-Employment-Service-Rating-102915.pdf">Student Employment Evaluation</a>

Please submit these forms to the Office of Financial Aid, Lee Hall 230, ATTN: Laura Needham. Signing these forms is encouraged but optional for the student.
<h2>Dismissals</h2>
A student is subject to dismissal from campus employment if the student
<ol>
	<li>exhibits improper behavior or insufficient skills for the job assignment, or</li>
	<li>does not report to work as scheduled.</li>
</ol>
At the discretion of the supervisor, two such incidents will result in a warning, with documentation of the incidents sent to the Student Employment Coordinator. A third incident will result in immediate dismissal from the employment position.

<strong>Note:</strong> a student is subject to immediate dismissal, <strong>with no prior warnings</strong>, from student employment if the student deliberately falsifies a timecard or deliberately violates the <a href="http://adminfinance.umw.edu/financialaid/files/2015/03/2015-2016-Confidentiality-Agreement.pdf">Confidentiality Agreement</a>. These are considered Honor Code violations and supervisors may report such incidents to the Honor Council.

In the event of a dismissal, please submit the above forms to the Office of Financial Aid, Lee Hall 230, ATTN: Laura Needham. Signing these forms is encouraged but optional for the student.
