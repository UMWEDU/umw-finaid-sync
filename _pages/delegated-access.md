<h2>Delegated Access for the Release of Information</h2>
Students have control over which individual(s) may have access to their academic and financial information and the length of time that the access is granted. Delegated access is limited to financial aid and final grade information only. When completing this process, students will also see the word “proxy” used to describe the access given to their selected individual(s).

To grant access, students must:
<ul>
	<li>Log into the student information system</li>
	<li>Select “Student and Financial Aid”</li>
	<li>Select “Delegated Access”</li>
	<li>Add Delegated User (proxy)</li>
</ul>
To remove access, students must:
<ul>
	<li>Log into the student information system</li>
	<li>Select “Student and Financial Aid”</li>
	<li>Select “Delegated Access”</li>
	<li>Remove Delegated User (proxy)</li>
</ul>
