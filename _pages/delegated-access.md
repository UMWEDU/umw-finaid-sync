Students have control over which individual(s) may have access to their academic and financial information and the length of time that the access is granted. Delegated access is limited to financial aid and final grade information only. When completing this process, students will also see the word “proxy” used to describe the access given to their selected individual(s).
<ol>
 	<li>Log-in the student Information system and select <a href="https://ssb.umw.edu/ssomanager/c/SSB?pkg=bwgkprxy.P_ManageProxy">Delegated Access</a></li>
 	<li>Add Proxy and enter in requested information<a href="http://www.umw.edu/financialaid/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2016/02/step2.png"><img id="longdesc-return-388" class="aligncenter wp-image-388 size-large" src="http://www.umw.edu/financialaid/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2016/02/step2-1024x443.png" alt="screenshot of 'add proxy' screen in Banner for Delegated Access" width="1024" height="443" longdesc="http://www.umw.edu/financialaid?longdesc=388&amp;referrer=8" /></a></li>
 	<li>Once the proxy information is added, TWO emails will be sent to the proxy.
<ol>
 	<li>EMAIL #1:The Delegated Access pages are available using UMW's Banner Web or through a proxy access login.  When you first contact the web site you will be asked to establish a password for subsequent logins. Use the password above as the 'Old Password', then create your new password and update your profile.<a href="http://www.umw.edu/financialaid/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2016/02/step3.png"><img id="longdesc-return-389" class="size-large wp-image-389 aligncenter" src="http://www.umw.edu/financialaid/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2016/02/step3-1024x269.png" alt="screenshot of Proxy Login page" width="1024" height="269" longdesc="http://www.umw.edu/financialaid?longdesc=389&amp;referrer=8" /></a></li>
 	<li>EMAIL #2:   The Delegated Access pages are available using UMW's Banner Web or through a proxy access login.  Hopefully you have already established your credentials and confirmed that your profile data is up to date.  The next step is for the student to authorize pages for your use.  Contact the student at the student's UMW email address and ask them to set your authorizations.</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li>Please select your relationship with the individual and provide a passphrase.  The passphrase will be used to determine FERPA identity during phone calls.<a href="http://www.umw.edu/financialaid/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2016/02/step4.png"><img id="longdesc-return-391" class="aligncenter wp-image-391 size-large" src="http://www.umw.edu/financialaid/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2016/02/step4-1024x429.png" alt="Screenshot of list of authorization items" width="1024" height="429" longdesc="http://www.umw.edu/financialaid?longdesc=391&amp;referrer=8" /></a><a href="http://www.umw.edu/financialaid/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2016/02/step4.2.png"><img id="longdesc-return-390" class="aligncenter wp-image-390 size-large" src="http://www.umw.edu/financialaid/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2016/02/step4.2-1024x292.png" alt="screenshot of Delegated Access Proxy Profile in Banner" width="1024" height="292" longdesc="http://www.umw.edu/financialaid?longdesc=390&amp;referrer=8" /></a></li>
