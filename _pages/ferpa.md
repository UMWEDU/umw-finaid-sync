University Offices have a series of information release processes to allow UMW representatives to speak with parents, or other third parties.

Due to Federal privacy regulation (FERPA), the Office of Financial Aid is only permitted to speak to students, and individuals that they have designated a ‘<a href="http://www.umw.edu/financialaid/general-information/communication/delegated-access/">delegated user</a>.'  This allows Financial Aid Representatives to speak to the third party about financial aid requirements, and award status.

The primary means of communication to students is the UMW email system. Students may contact the Office of Financial Aid at <a href="mailto:finaid@umw.edu">finaid@umw.edu</a>. Required documents may also be sent by email to this address. Students and families may also contact the Financial Aid office by phone 540-654-2468 or by visiting the office in Lee Hall, second floor.

Please keep in mind that Financial Aid requirements may be added due to the FAFSA Verification process. Financial Aid awards may also change based on updates to the student’s FAFSA or enrollment changes.  Students will receive an email notification if any changes are made to their financial aid award or financial aid requirements. This email notification will go to the student only.
