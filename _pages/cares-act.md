<h2>Introduction</h2>
On March 27, 2020, the President of the United States signed the CARES Act (H.R. 748), which provides emergency relief funds to organizations and individuals affected by the coronavirus pandemic. The Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund (HEERF), found in Section 18004 of the CARES Act, provides funding to institutions of higher education "to prevent, prepare for, and respond to coronavirus." As a result of receiving this funding, UMW is required by the U.S. Department of Education to report the information listed below within 30 days of receiving funding and every 45 days thereafter.

<h4>Acknowledgment of Funding and Certification</h4>

The University of Mary Washington reviewed, signed, and returned the U.S. Department of Education's certification and agreement for these funds on April 14, 2020, and we received the allocation for the student emergency grants (half of the total award) on April 23, 2020. In keeping with the terms of the certification, UMW will use no less than 50 percent of the funds received under Section 18004(a)(1) of the CARES Act to provide emergency financial aid grants directly to students.

<h4>Total Emergency Grant Funding</h4>

As a result of Congress passing the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act, UMW has been allocated $1,444,341 in emergency student aid to assist eligible students who incurred “expenses related to the disruption of campus operations due to coronavirus, such as food, housing, course materials, technology, health care, and child-care expenses.” UMW will disburse the funds within a year of 4/23/2020 when funds were issued.

<h4>Overview</h4>

Once the CARES Act was passed into law, it fell to the Department of Education (ED) to provide guidance to higher education institutions regarding implementation of the provisions. Guidance from ED was key in determining how the funds would be distributed to our students. The key components of this guidance that played a factor in our decision are the following:

• Funds can only be awarded to students for “expenses related to the disruption of campus operations due to coronavirus, such as food, housing, course materials, technology, health care, and child-care expenses.”

• Students receiving these funds must meet the eligibility criteria in Section 484 of the Title IV Higher Education Act. This includes, but is not limited to, the demonstration of the following: be making satisfactory academic progress; not owe an overpayment on Title IV grants or loans; not be in default on a Title IV loan; file "as part of the original financial aid application process" a certification that includes statement of educational purpose and valid Social Security Number, be a U.S. citizen or national, permanent resident, or other eligible noncitizen; have returned fraudulently obtained Title IV funds if convicted of or pled guilty or no contest to charges; not have fraudulently received Title IV loans in excess of annual or aggregate limits; have repaid Title IV loan amounts in excess of annual or aggregate limits if obtained inadvertently; have Selective Service registration verified (if student is a male); not have a federal or state conviction for drug possession or sale, with certain time limitations. While this does not specify students must complete a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), the only way to determine if a student meets the Section 484 requirements is for a FAFSA to be filed.

<h4>Who will receive funds?</h4>
As a result of this guidance, UMW will be awarding the emergency financial aid funds from the CARES Act to the following groups of students, and under the following conditions:

Group 1: Title IV eligible students meeting Section 484 of the Higher Education Act who have expressed challenges related to computer/internet access with the switch to online classes. Students must complete an application to be eligible for funds.

Group 2: Summer 2020 enrolled students who are in a degree program, enrolled an have a 2019-20 FAFSA on file with UMW, meet the Section 484 criteria, and have an Expected Family Contribution (EFC) from the FAFSA of 0, Pell eligible and have completed an application for funds.

Group 3: Pell Eligible Students who lived on Campus for the spring semester who did not previously meet one of the other conditions in Group 1 or 2.

Group 4: Funds will be saved to help students who have additional challenges related to the disruption of normal campus operations.

Group 5: Purchasing personal computers and technology needs for online education classes.

Group 6: Remaining funds will be used to provide financial assistance to students with COVID-19 financial disruptions and to needy Federal Pell grant recipients.

<h4>Student eligibility</h4>
The number of potential eligible students who were enrolled for the spring 2020 semester who met the general criteria under section 484 of the 1965 Higher Education Act is 2,256. However, the number of students who will meet our criteria and have need will be less. Students will need to have completed the FAFSA by 5/1/2020 for Spring/Summer 2020.

The current maximum amount a student will receive under the initial allocation will be $1,000 or less based on the students need (EFC) and answers on the COVID Relief Application. Students have been awarded between $250-1,000.

<strong>Fall 2020 Criteria</strong>

Students must have completed the 2021 FAFSA and be enrolled.

The current maximum a student will receive at any one time is $1,000.

Students with technology needs were identified and awarded funding via survey's and other means.
Students with ongoing challenges are awarded as needed.

To date we have awarded $560,025.00 to 656 students.

<h4>Reporting Requirements</h4>


<h4><strong>CARES Act Institutional Funding</strong></h4>
The Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act also allocated $1,440,340 in institutional support. UMW used these funds to offset the cost of providing refunds to students for Spring 2020 housing, meal plans and parking fees. The link below is to UMW’s report on these funds as required by the Department of Education.
