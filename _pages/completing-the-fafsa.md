The Office of Financial Aid strives to make the FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) process as easy as possible for UMW students by offering a variety of <a href="http://www.umw.edu/financialaid/process/financial-aid-events/">workshops and chats</a> throughout the spring both at our campus, and off-site at local high schools.

The <a href="https://fafsa.ed.gov/">online FAFSA</a> will guide you through the different sections of the FAFSA. Begin by clicking the “Start a New FAFSA” button, and follow the directions on the screen.  Here are some tips to completing your FAFSA correctly.
<h2>FSAID</h2>
You’ll need an <a href="https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/fafsa/filling-out/fsaid">FSA ID</a>, a username and password combination that allows you to sign your FAFSA electronically. Your FSA ID also can be used to sign loan contracts and to access certain information online. You can get your FSA ID as you fill out the FAFSA, but you also have the option to get it ahead of time.
<h2>Information Needed to Apply</h2>
The FAFSA asks for information about you (your name, date of birth, address, etc.) and about your financial situation. Depending on your circumstances (for instance, when you filed taxes or what tax form you used), you might need the following information or documents as you fill out the FAFSA:
<ul>
	<li>Your Social Security number (it’s important that you enter it correctly on the FAFSA!)</li>
	<li>Your parents’ Social Security numbers if you are a <em>dependent student</em></li>
	<li>Your driver’s license number if you have one</li>
	<li>Your Alien Registration number if you are not a U.S. citizen</li>
	<li>Federal tax information or tax returns including IRS W-2 information, for you (and your spouse, if you are married), and for your parents if you are a dependent student:
<ul>
	<li>IRS 1040, 1040A, 1040EZ</li>
	<li>Foreign tax return and/or</li>
	<li>Tax return for Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the U.S. Virgin Islands, the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, or Palau</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Records of your (and, if you are a dependent student, your parents’) untaxed income, such as child support received, interest income, and veterans non-education benefits</li>
	<li>Information on cash; savings and checking account balances; investments, including stocks and bonds and real estate but not including the home in which you live; and business and farm assets for you, and for your parents if you are a dependent student</li>
</ul>
<h4>Keep these records! You may need them again. Do not mail your records to us.</h4>
<h3>Determining Dependency Status</h3>
The FAFSA asks a series of questions that determine whether you are a <a href="https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/fafsa/filling-out/dependency">dependent or independent student</a> for purposes of applying for federal student aid. If you are a dependent student, you must report parent information, as well as your own information, on your FAFSA.
<h3>Reporting Financial Information</h3>
The FAFSA asks for financial information, including balances of savings and checking accounts and information from tax forms.
<ul>
	<li>Use income records for the tax year prior to the academic year for which you are applying. For instance, if you are filling out the 2016-17 FAFSA, you will need 2015 tax information.</li>
	<li>If you haven’t done your taxes by the time you fill out your FAFSA, it’s okay to estimate the amounts. You might want to base your estimates on last year’s tax return. If your income changed drastically since last year’s tax return, you may click on “Income Estimator” on the FAFSA page that asks for income information. The Income Estimator will help you estimate adjusted gross income (AGI)<em>.</em> After you file your taxes, you’ll need to log back in to the FAFSA and correct any estimated information that was wrong.</li>
	<li>If you have done your taxes before filling out your FAFSA, be sure to consider the option to use the IRS Data Retrieval Tool (IRS DRT). You may be able to use the tool if you filed your taxes electronically at least two weeks prior or if you filed on paper at least eight weeks prior. Here’s how the IRS DRT process works:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<ol>
<ol>
	<li>The IRS DRT takes you to the IRS website, where you’ll need to log in by providing your name and other information exactly as you provided it on your tax return.</li>
	<li>At the IRS site, you can preview your information before agreeing to have it transferred to your FAFSA.</li>
	<li>When you return to the FAFSA, you’ll see that questions populated with tax information marked “Transferred from the IRS.” Don’t make any changes to those answers (except where Individual Retirement Accounts or pension rollovers are involved), or you’ll invalidate the information you retrieved.</li>
	<li>If you or your parents are married and you’ve used IRS DRT to transfer information into your FAFSA, you’ll see that a value for Income Earned from Work is transferred.</li>
</ol>
</ol>
</ol>
<h2>The Next Steps</h2>
When you click “submit,” the office of Federal Student Aid at the U.S. Department of Education will send you a <em>Student Aid Report</em> (SAR), which is a summary of the FAFSA data you submitted. You’ll get your SAR within three days to three weeks after you submit your FAFSA. Be sure to look over your SAR to make sure you didn’t make a <a href="https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/fafsa/next-steps#correct-mistakes">mistake on your FAFSA</a>. Find out more about the<a href="https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/fafsa/next-steps/student-aid-report"> Student Aid Report</a><i> </i>and its purpose, and how the type of FAFSA you file determines when you’ll get the SAR and what you should do with it.

The SAR won’t tell you how much financial aid you’ll get. Instead, if you applied for admission to a college or career school and have been accepted, and you listed that school on your FAFSA, <a href="https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/fafsa/next-steps/how-calculated">the school will calculate your aid</a> and will send you an electronic or paper <a href="https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/fafsa/next-steps/comparing-aid-offers">aid offer</a>, sometimes called an award letter, telling you how much aid you’re eligible for at the school.

The information on this page is found on the <a href="https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/fafsa/filling-out">Federal Student Aid website</a>, which is an excellent resource for all students using federal aid (Direct Loans, Plus Loans, Federal Pell Grant, etc), especially while filling out the FAFSA.
