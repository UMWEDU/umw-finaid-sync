<strong>IMPORTANT: The 2017-2018 FAFSA will be available October 1, 2016. </strong>

New FAFSA priority filing deadlines:
<ul>
 	<li>Incoming 2017-2018 Freshman Students - February 1, 2017</li>
 	<li>Incoming 2017-2018 Transfer Students - April 1, 2017</li>

</ul>
The Office of Financial Aid strives to make the FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) process as easy as possible for UMW students by offering a variety of <a href="http://www.umw.edu/financialaid/process/financial-aid-events/">workshops and chats</a>  both at our campus, and off-site at local high schools.

Here are some tips for completing an <a href="https://fafsa.ed.gov/">online FAFSA</a>.

<span style="font-size: large">All undergraduate students that do NOT file the FAFSA by the priority filing date of Feb. 1 will continue to be eligible for <a href="http://www.umw.edu/financialaid/types/loans/student-loans/">Federal Direct Student Loans</a>, and <a href="http://www.umw.edu/financialaid/types/federal-grants/">federal grants</a>. Other funds (<a href="http://www.umw.edu/financialaid/types/virginia-state-grants/">Virginia State Grants</a>, <a href="http://www.umw.edu/financialaid/types/scholarship-opportunities/">scholarships</a>, etc.) will not be available after that date.</span>
<h2>FSAID</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>Apply for an <a href="https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/fafsa/filling-out/fsaid">FSA ID</a>, a username and password combination that allows you to sign your FAFSA electronically.</li>
 	<li>You can get your FSA ID as you fill out the FAFSA, but you also have the option to get it ahead of time.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Information Needed for the FAFSA</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>Student , parent and/or spouse Social Security Numbers</li>
 	<li>Student driver's license</li>
 	<li> Alien Registration number if you are not a U.S. citizen</li>
 	<li>Federal tax information or tax returns including IRS W-2 information, for you (and your spouse, if you are married), and for your parents if you are a dependent student:
<ul>
 	<li>IRS 1040, 1040A, 1040EZ</li>
 	<li>Foreign tax return and/or</li>
 	<li>Tax return for Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the U.S. Virgin Islands, the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, or Palau</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Student, parent and/or spouse untaxed income, such as child support received, interest income, and veterans non-education benefits</li>
</ul>
<h3>Determining Dependency Status</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>The FAFSA asks a series of questions that determine whether you are a <a href="https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/fafsa/filling-out/dependency">dependent or independent student</a> for purposes of applying for federal student aid. If you are a dependent student, you must report parent information, as well as your own information, on your FAFSA.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Reporting Financial Information</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Use two-year prior tax data. For instance, if you are filling out the 2017-18 FAFSA, use 2015 tax information..</li>
 	<li>If eligible, use the IRS Data Retrieval Tool (IRS DRT) - <span style="color: #c70000"><strong>THIS OPTION IS NOT AVAILABLE AT THE MOMENT</strong>.</span></li>
</ul>
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none">
<ol>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none">
<ol>
 	<li>The IRS DRT will direct you to the IRS website</li>
 	<li>Log in by providing your name and other information exactly as you provided it on your tax return.</li>
 	<li>At the IRS site, preview your information before agreeing to have it transferred to your FAFSA.</li>
 	<li>When you return to the FAFSA, you’ll see that questions populated with tax information marked “Transferred from the IRS.” Don’t make any changes to those answers (except where Individual Retirement Accounts or pension rollovers are involved), or you’ll invalidate the information you retrieved.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>FAFSA- The Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
 	<li><a href="https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/fafsa/next-steps/student-aid-report">Student Aid Report</a>(SAR) will be sent to the email address provided by the student on the FAFSA approximately three days after submitting the FAFSA.</li>
 	<li>Review your SAR to make sure you didn’t make a <a href="https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/fafsa/next-steps#correct-mistakes">mistake on your FAFSA</a>.</li>
 	<li>The SAR will provide information to the financial aid office to determine your financial aid eligibility.</li>
 	<li>If your two years prior tax information has changed significantly due to income changes, change in number of family members in the household, etc. please contact the UMW Office of Financial Aid to determine if a change to your financial aid eligibility is needed.</li>
</ul>
