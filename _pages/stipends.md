<h2>There are three things you should know before proceeding with the stipend process:</h2>
<ol>
	<li>The total amount of the stipend contract must be paid out in smaller, biweekly payments until the end of the contract period (non-exemption rule).</li>
	<li>Student employees who receive biweekly stipend payments are still required to clock their hours in MyTime (non-exemption rule).</li>
	<li>Stipend contracts must be approved by Human Resources before they can go into effect. If a stipend is not approved, the position will need to have an hourly pay rate assigned to it. For this step of the process, please complete and submit an <a href="http://adminfinance.umw.edu/financialaid/files/2016/02/EWP-blank.docx">EWP</a> for the stipend position to Paula Wilder (<a href="mailto:pwilder@umw.edu">pwilder@umw.edu</a>).</li>
</ol>
<h2>Once a stipend for a position has been approved:</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Create a stipend contract for the position. Contact the Student Employment Coordinator for a sample. This contract will eventually be signed by the students who are assigned this position.</li>
	<li>Complete the hiring process as detailed on the “<a href="http://www.umw.edu/financialaid/student-employment/supervisors/hire-a-student-employee/">Hire a Student Employee</a>” page as normal.</li>
	<li>After a student has been hired for the position, the student needs to sign a copy of the stipend contract. The student may sign the contract before receiving a work authorization, but the student cannot actually begin working until he has been authorized to work.</li>
	<li>Send a copy of the signed contract to the Student Employment Coordinator in Office of Financial Aid, Lee Hall 230.</li>
</ol>
