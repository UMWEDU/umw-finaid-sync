<h2>Transfer Merit Scholarship</h2>
<h3><strong>The University of Mary Washington will change or rescind merit scholarships in the event housing or residency status changes after awarding</strong><strong>.</strong></h3>
The university will credit one-half of the scholarship each semester to the student’s account (Fall/Spring). The recipient qualifies to receive a scholarship for up to six regular semesters of continuous study at the University of Mary Washington if all of the following conditions are satisfied:
<ul>
 	<li>Recipients must be <strong>full-time</strong> at the University of Mary Washington and successfully complete at least 12 credit hours each semester.</li>
 	<li>Current scholars who have maintained eligibility may use a merit scholarship for <em>pre-approved study abroad programs</em>.  The Office of Financial Aid must receive written permission from the Center for International Education prior to the semester abroad term.  Participation will be limited to one period of study, not to exceed two semesters.  The University of Mary Washington will use study abroad credit hours equivalent to full-time enrollment transferred back to the University for consideration if scholarship eligibility for the subsequent year.  Study abroad participants must return to the University of Mary Washington as full-time residence hall students to complete their degree requirements. Students may review the process for using merit scholarships for study abroad programs <a href="http://www.umw.edu/financialaid/eligibility/study-abroad/">here</a>.</li>
 	<li>Students participating in an internship in which the student resides off campus may not use the scholarship.</li>
 	<li>The recipient must maintain a yearly grade point average (not cumulative average) of at least 2.5 on a 4.0 scale.</li>
 	<li>Should the recipient be placed on social or administrative probation, or be found guilty of an Honor Code violation, the scholarship will be withdrawn and charges to the student shall be adjusted according to the University’s refund policy.</li>
 	<li>An adjustment to the amount of the scholarship will be made according to the University’s refund policy should the recipient withdraw during the academic year.</li>
