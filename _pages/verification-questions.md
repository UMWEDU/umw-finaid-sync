<h2>How will I know if I am selected for Verification?</h2>
Students are selected for Verification by the Department of Education. The selected student FAFSA information is forwarded to the Office of Financial Aid, where financial aid officers are required to verify the information.

Students are notified on their Student Aid Report (SAR), which they receive from the Department of Education after submitting their FAFSA. They can also view their Verification requirements through their myUMW portal at any time after their FAFSA is received. The Office of Financial Aid sends monthly notifications to the student’s UMW email account.
<h2>Why was I selected for Verification?</h2>
There are several reasons why you may have been selected for Verification. Most Verifications are actually randomly chosen FAFSAs. Other reasons may include an incomplete FAFSA, or a FAFSA that contains estimated information.
<h2>What do I have to submit and where do I send it?</h2>
Once you are selected for Verification, all requirements will be added to your Financial Aid Requirement list, as seen through your myUMW portal. These items include (but are not limited to) a Verification Worksheet, tax information from the IRS, and copies of W2s or other wage statements.

Please note that the Office of Financial Aid is not able to accept copies of tax returns to satisfy tax requirements. The easiest way to satisfy these requirements is to transfer your tax information directly into the FAFSA by using the IRS Data Retrieval Tool.  You may also order and submit a <a href="http://irs.gov">Tax Return Transcript</a>.

These items can be submitted by email to <a href="mailto:finaid@umw.edu">finaid@umw.edu</a> or by fax to (540)654-1858.
<h2>What happens once I submit my documents?</h2>
Once you submit your documents to the Office of Financial Aid, you can continue to check the status through your myUMW portal. When we receive your documents, the status changes to “Received but not Reviewed.” When Verification is complete, your document status changes to “Received and Reviewed” and is accompanied by a green checkmark.

It is common for your Financial Aid Officer to request additional documents during this process. Please be sure to also monitor your UMW email account.
<h2>What if I don’t complete the Verification process?</h2>
The Verification process is a federal regulation and must be completed in order for a student to receive financial aid, as well as any state or institutional need-based aid. If you do not plan to complete this process or receive financial aid, please contact the Office of Financial Aid office so we can update your status.
