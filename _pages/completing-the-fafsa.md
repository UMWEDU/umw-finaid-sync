<strong>IMPORTANT: The 2017-2018 FAFSA will be available October 1, 2016. </strong>

New FAFSA filing deadlines:
<ul>
 	<li>Incoming 2017-2018 Freshman Students - February 1, 2017</li>

The Office of Financial Aid strives to make the FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) process as easy as possible for UMW students by offering a variety of <a href="http://www.umw.edu/financialaid/process/financial-aid-events/">workshops and chats</a>  both at our campus, and off-site at local high schools.

Here are some tips for completing an <a href="https://fafsa.ed.gov/">online FAFSA</a>.

After the FAFSA filing deadline, all undergraduate students continue to be eligible for <a href="http://www.umw.edu/financialaid/types/loans/student-loans/">Federal Direct Student Loans</a>, and <a href="http://www.umw.edu/financialaid/types/federal-grants/">federal grants</a>. Other funds (<a href="http://www.umw.edu/financialaid/types/virginia-state-grants/">Virginia State Grants</a>, <a href="http://www.umw.edu/financialaid/types/scholarship-opportunities/">scholarships</a>, etc.) will not be available after that date.
<h2>FSAID</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>You’ll need an <a href="https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/fafsa/filling-out/fsaid">FSA ID</a>, a username and password combination that allows you to sign your FAFSA electronically. Your FSA ID also can be used to sign loan contracts and to access certain information online.</li>
 	<li>You can get your FSA ID as you fill out the FAFSA, but you also have the option to get it ahead of time.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Information Needed to Apply</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>Student , parent and/or spouse Social Security Numbers</li>
 	<li>Student driver's license</li>
 	<li> Alien Registration number if you are not a U.S. citizen</li>
 	<li>Federal tax information or tax returns including IRS W-2 information, for you (and your spouse, if you are married), and for your parents if you are a dependent student:
<ul>
 	<li>IRS 1040, 1040A, 1040EZ</li>
 	<li>Foreign tax return and/or</li>
 	<li>Tax return for Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the U.S. Virgin Islands, the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, or Palau</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Student, parent and/or spouse untaxed income, such as child support received, interest income, and veterans non-education benefits</li>
</ul>
<h3>Determining Dependency Status</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>The FAFSA asks a series of questions that determine whether you are a <a href="https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/fafsa/filling-out/dependency">dependent or independent student</a> for purposes of applying for federal student aid. If you are a dependent student, you must report parent information, as well as your own information, on your FAFSA.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Reporting Financial Information</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Use income records for the tax year two years prior to the academic year for which you are applying. For instance, if you are filling out the 2017-18 FAFSA, you will need 2015 tax information..</li>
 	<li>If you have done your taxes before filling out your FAFSA, be sure to consider the option to use the IRS Data Retrieval Tool (IRS DRT). You may be able to use the tool if you filed your taxes electronically at least two weeks prior or if you filed on paper at least eight weeks prior. Here’s how the IRS DRT process works:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<ol>
<ol>
 	<li>The IRS DRT takes you to the IRS website, where you’ll need to log in by providing your name and other information exactly as you provided it on your tax return.</li>
 	<li>At the IRS site, you can preview your information before agreeing to have it transferred to your FAFSA.</li>
 	<li>When you return to the FAFSA, you’ll see that questions populated with tax information marked “Transferred from the IRS.” Don’t make any changes to those answers (except where Individual Retirement Accounts or pension rollovers are involved), or you’ll invalidate the information you retrieved.</li>
 	<li>If you or your parents are married and you’ve used IRS DRT to transfer information into your FAFSA, you’ll see that a value for Income Earned from Work is transferred.</li>
</ol>
</ol>
</ol>
<h2>The Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>Student Aid Report (SAR) will be sent to the email address provided by the student on the FAFSA approximately three days after submitting the FAFSA. Be sure to look over your SAR to make sure you didn’t make a <a href="https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/fafsa/next-steps#correct-mistakes">mistake on your FAFSA</a>. Find out more about the<a href="https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/fafsa/next-steps/student-aid-report"> Student Aid Report</a><i> </i>and its purpose, and how the type of FAFSA you file determines when you’ll get the SAR and what you should do with it.</li>
 	<li>The SAR will provide information to the financial aid office to determine your financial aid eligibility.</li>
 	<li>If your two years prior tax information has changed significantly due to income changes, change in number of family members in the household, etc. please contact the UMW Office of Financial Aid to determine if a change to your financial aid eligibility is needed.</li>
</ul>
