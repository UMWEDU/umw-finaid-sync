<h2>Accessing Paystubs and W-2s</h2>
<strong>After your first payday</strong>, you may access your pay stubs and W-2 online at Virginia Payline. Paydays are listed in the above linked payroll schedules.
<ul>
	<li>Visit <a href="https://payline.doa.virginia.gov/">Virginia Payline</a>.</li>
	<li>Select “Forgot Password/New Account” at the left-hand corner.</li>
	<li>Enter your Employee ID.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Where can I locate my Employee ID?</strong> You will receive an e-mail to your UMW address containing your Employee ID, typically around your first payday.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Payroll will send a temporary password to your UMW e-mail address, normally within 48 business hours.</li>
</ul>
Create a new, permanent password after you log on for the first time.
