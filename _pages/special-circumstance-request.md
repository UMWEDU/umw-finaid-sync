<h2>Special Circumstance</h2>
If the information you filed on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) does not reflect your current financial situation or does not take into account an unusual circumstance with you and/or your family you may submit a request for review of your financial aid status for special circumstances.   This may occur due to your FAFSA being based on two years prior tax information.

In certain circumstances, the Financial Aid Office may make adjustments to the FAFSA information to more accurately reflect the current situation.

These situations may include (but are not limited to):
<ul>
 	<li>Death in the family resulting in decreased yearly income</li>
 	<li>Unusual Medical Expenses</li>
 	<li>Involuntary job loss of a family member</li>
 	<li>Loss of other income, such as child support, disability benefits, etc.</li>
 	<li>Divorce or separation after the FAFSA has been filed</li>
</ul>
Examples of situations that can not be considered Special Circumstance include:
<ul>
 	<li>Voluntary job loss</li>
 	<li>Removing funds early from a retirement account to pay debt</li>
 	<li>Loss of other income that can not be documented or was not  court ordered</li>
</ul>
NOTE: Even if an adjustment is made, it may not result in additional aid.

To process a request for review we must have the following:
<ul>
 	<li>The current academic year FAFSA must be on file with the University of Mary Washington</li>
 	<li>You must be accepted for Admission and/or continuing a degree seeking program</li>
 	<li>You must be meeting <a href="http://www.umw.edu/financialaid/eligibility/satisfactory-academic-progress/">Satisfactory Academic Progress Standards</a></li>
 	<li>The Office of Financial Aid must have a completed Special Circumstance Request with all required documentation</li>
 	<li>All forms must be SIGNED</li>
 	<li>A minimum of 16 consecutive weeks of income loss is required for appeals based on loss of earnings.  Please submit your request after this period.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Additional documents may be requested throughout the process.</h4>
The parent and/or student must submit the <a href="http://www.umw.edu/financialaid/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2016/10/SpecialCircumstance1617.doc">Special Circumstance Request Form</a><em><strong> </strong></em>and all required documentation before the committee will review.  Responses are sent by mail or email within two weeks after a decision is made.  The University of Mary Washington (UMW) will begin reviewing letters of special circumstance in early April for the following academic year for all new UMW students.  Continuing student requests are reviewed in late June. Requests received after that time will be processed as they are submitted.  <strong>We are unable to consider loss of employment due to voluntary separation or a decrease in income for a student considered dependent on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid.</strong>
