When a student withdraws, graduates, or drops below half-time attendance (regardless if you plan to transfer to another school), regulations require that you complete an exit counseling session for your Federal Direct subsidized or unsubsidized loans. The counseling session provides information about how to manage and pay your student loans after college.

Loan Exit Counseling is located on the <a href="http://www.studentloans.govhttps://studentloans.gov/myDirectLoan/index.action" target="_blank" rel="noopener">StudentLoans.gov website</a>.
