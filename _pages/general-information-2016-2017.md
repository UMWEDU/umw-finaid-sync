<h2>Carefully read all notices and enclosures from the Office of Financial Aid!</h2>
Each year, the University of Mary Washington administers over $33 million in financial assistance, including educational loans of $20 million, for students at both campuses.  The Office of Financial Aid assists applicants by awarding resources to help pay for college through a variety of grants, scholarships, and loans from federal, state, institutional and private sources.  The Office also administers the Federal College Work Study and Institutional student employment programs.

To receive need-based financial aid, a student is required to have valid results from filing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA).  Students’ award letters reflect all need-based and merit scholarships, grants and loans for which they are eligible.
<h3>Tuition Payment Plans</h3>
Families requiring additional funds to pay college costs may consider the tuition payment plan offered through the <a href="http://www.umw.edu/studentaccounts">Office of Students Accounts</a> or parent and private, educational loans.  Payment plans are offered in a variety of options to best fit the family circumstances.
<h3>UMW Scholarships</h3>
For consideration of UMW Foundation Scholarships, complete the <a href="https://umw.scholarships.ngwebsolutions.com">online Scholarship Application</a> by May 1<sup>st</sup>. All merit, foundation, and departmental scholarships require students to be enrolled full-time each semester.  In addition, with the exception of the Transfer Award, students receiving Admissions merit awards are also required to live on campus for all semesters.
<h3><a href="http://www.umw.edu/financialaid/process/completing-the-fafsa/verification/verification-questions/">Verification</a></h3>
All students selected for verification by the federal government must submit the appropriate paperwork to the Office of Financial Aid by July 1<sup>st</sup> to insure timely processing.  Required paperwork is listed at the bottom of your award letter and also on MyUMW under “Student Financial Aid”.  Students who do not submit required documents by July 1st are considered late filers and can have their awards canceled after that date.  Once canceled, some types of scholarships or grant aid will not be reinstated.  Students will receive an email notification of any award changes
<h3><a href="http://www.umw.edu/financialaid/process/award-notifications/">Award Letter Notification</a></h3>
Incoming Freshmen and Transfer Students will receive an initial mailed packet that provides award information and then future email notifications regarding any changes.  Continuing students are notified of their requirements and financial aid awards through their UMW e-mail addresses with appropriate web links and instructions to visit their MyUMW portal. Continuing students will not receive an award packet through the mail.  Continuing students wanting a paper copy may print the pages from MyUMW.  In all cases, the   Awards in ‘Offered’ status on the student portal page are estimated until the student completes the necessary requirements.
<h3><a href="http://www.umw.edu/financialaid/eligibility/enrollment-requirements/">Enrollment Requirements </a></h3>
All Undergraduate awards are based on full-time enrollment (12 credits) and all graduate awards are based on half-time enrollment (5 credits).  The official enrollment determination or census date for financial aid occurs two weeks after the start of classes during the registration “add/drop” period. <strong> </strong>Enrollment status is locked at that time and eligibility is reviewed for all financial aid prior to disbursement.  All students must enroll at least half-time to be eligible to receive financial aid.  However, private education loans may differ depending on the lender.
<h3>Award Changes</h3>
Students with changes to their awards receive e-mail notices to the students UMW e-mail. Revisions are made when aid changes due to the verification process or adjustments are made to the cost of attendance, enrollment or housing status. Awards are estimated until the student's file is complete and all information verified.  Questions regarding revised awards may be directed to the Office of Financial Aid<strong>.  </strong><strong> </strong>
<h3>Coursework Taken at Another School</h3>
Financial aid can be awarded and processed for classes taken at another school with approval by the Registrar’s Office and a completed Financial Aid consortium agreement between the two schools.  It is best to discuss this option with both offices prior to registering for outside coursework.
<h3>Check Your UMW Email and MyUMW Regularly</h3>
Students are notified via e-mail or student portal of changes to processes and procedures. Additionally, during the fall and spring semesters, the Office of Financial Aid issues all general notices and information through UMW e-mails and student portals. Parents are invited to visit our website to stay informed.
<h3><a href="http://www.umw.edu/financialaid/eligibility/bookstore-voucher/">Using Financial Aid for Books</a></h3>
Bookstore voucher requests are available on-line through the MyUMW portal. Vouchers are approved for students with complete financial aid files and meet one or more of the following rules:
<ul>
	<li>Have a complete financial aid file with sufficient financial aid awarded by UMW to cover their direct costs plus books, AND</li>
	<li>Are making SAP at the time of their request OR</li>
	<li>Have a book allowance approvals from outside agencies (in this case, you must contact the Student Accounts Office to receive a book voucher)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Credit Balance Refunds</h3>
When students’ financial assistance exceeds their charges, credit balances are created on a student’s account.  UMW financial aid disbursement occurs approximately four weeks after classes start.  Credit balances are refunded to the student within 14 days after disbursement occurs.  Students should budget accordingly for their living expenses.
<h3><a href="http://www.umw.edu/financialaid/types/loans/student-loans/">Federal Direct Loans Requirements</a></h3>
All students must accept their Direct Loans online in the MyUMW Financial Aid portal.  First-time Federal Direct Loan borrowers at UMW must complete Loan Entrance Counseling and sign a <a href="https://studentloans.gov">Master Promissory Note</a>.  Continuing students who borrowed in a previous year do not have any additional requirements for these loans.  Late FAFSA filers may still receive student loans for fall or spring enrollment but loans must be processed prior to the end of the corresponding semester.
<h3><a href="http://www.umw.edu/financialaid/types/loans/private/">Private Sources of Financial Aid</a></h3>
Students must notify the Office of Financial Aid of any outside scholarships, grants or loans that they expect to receive in 2016-17. These types of assistance may reduce eligibility for certain State grants, UMW scholarships or grants and federal loans.  Outside Private scholarships are combined under UMW Resources and listed by total, not individual amounts, on the award letter.  Unless otherwise specified by the donor, private scholarships are equally applied to both semesters.
<h3><a href="http://www.umw.edu/financialaid/process/completing-the-fafsa/verification/special-situations/">Special Circumstances</a></h3>
Should a family’s financial circumstances change after filing the FAFSA, consideration for review of those circumstances is granted if the change involves one of the following situations:
<ul>
	<li>unemployment or layoff of a parent (for dependent students) or spouse (independent students),</li>
	<li>retirement of a parent or spouse,</li>
	<li>reduction of income of a parent or spouse due to company downsizing,</li>
	<li>divorce or separation,</li>
	<li>death of a parent or spouse,</li>
	<li>a catastrophic event such as flood, fire or other natural disaster that effected the family income or</li>
	<li>unusual medical expenditures in excess of 10% of the family’s incom</li>
</ul>
There are situations that are not considered to be special circumstances and therefore are not eligible for review.  These include:
<ul>
	<li>tuition charges for private elementary and secondary schools,</li>
	<li>independent students or parents (dependent students) who voluntarily terminate full-time employment or</li>
	<li>family indebtedness from mortgages, excessive credit card debt or personal loans not associated with medical issues.</li>
</ul>
Special circumstance situations are reviewed on a case-by-case basis. A special form is available on the <a href="http://www.umw.edu/financialaid/forms/">financial aid website</a>. Please submit all documentation together in one packet and note the student’s Banner ID number on each page.
<h3><a href="https://www.umw.edu/financialaid/eligibility/satisfactory-academic-progress/">Satisfactory Academic Progress</a></h3>
Undergraduate students are required under federal regulation to maintain progress toward graduation and complete their degree within 6 years of beginning classes for their Bachelor’s degree.

To successfully meet this requirement, UMW has set the following SAP policy:
<ul>
	<li>Students must maintain a cumulative GPA of 1.8, 1.9 and 2.0 for freshmen, sophomore and junior/senior years respectively.</li>
	<li>Students must complete 70% of the credits that they attempt within a semester (fall, spring or summer).</li>
	<li>Undergraduate students must complete their Bachelor Degree within the 150% rule (6 years).</li>
</ul>
The Office of Financial Aid reviews SAP at the end of each semester, after the Registrar’s Office has posted the academic grades.  Students who fail to meet the requirements are notified by letter and email that SAP has been reviewed and the appropriate status applied to their eligibility.  An appeal process does exist for students affected by this policy.

Students who don’t meet these requirements for the first time are given a “SAP Warning” status and are eligible to receive their financial aid awards for the following semester but must meet SAP requirements by the end of that semester.  Students who don’t meet the requirements for a second time will lose their financial aid eligibility for the next semester.
