<h2>Federal Pell Grant</h2>
The Federal Pell Grant is automatically awarded to undergraduate students that meet all qualifications. Students must complete the FAFSA and demonstrate a specific level of financial need. This level changes each academic year.

The amount of the Federal Pell Grant also changes each year, as determined by the U.S. Department of Education. Amounts are based on a student’s financial need, institutional estimated cost of attendance, and enrollment status. Students may receive the Federal Pell Grant at one institution per semester, and cannot receive the grant more than 12 semesters.

Year-round Pell will be available to eligible students for 2017-2018 award year.  This change to the Federal Pell Grant Program allows eligible students to receive up to 150 percent of a regular Federal Pell Grant Award over the course of the academic year (Fall, Spring, and Summer).  To be eligible to receive the additional Pell Grant funds, the student must be otherwise eligible to receive Pell Grant funds for the payment period and must be enrolled at least half-time.
<h2>Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG)</h2>
The FSEOG grant is awarded to undergraduate students with exceptional financial need, as determined by the FAFSA. Students that complete the FAFSA, and meet all other qualifications, are automatically awarded.
