<h2>Using Financial Aid for Study Abroad</h2>
Students may apply to use their UMW financial aid for Study Abroad. In coordination with the UMW Center for International Education, students must complete the <strong>Request for Study Abroad Financial Aid Form</strong><strong>.</strong>

<a href="http://www.umw.edu/financialaid/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2016/02/Study-Abroad-Form-AY.docx" rel="">Study Abroad Form - Fall, Spring, or Academic year</a>

<a href="http://www.umw.edu/financialaid/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2016/02/Study-Abroad-Form-Summer.docx" rel="">Study Abroad Form - Summer</a>
<h3>The Process</h3>
The Request for Study Abroad Financial Aid form, along with supporting documentation, is submitted to the Office of Financial Aid. Students are encouraged to meet with a Financial Aid representative at that time to discuss the specifics of the financial aid process.

The Financial Aid Representative then works with the student’s Study Abroad program to complete a Consortium Agreement. In this agreement, the Study Abroad program agrees to report any changes to the student’s enrollment, and the home school (UMW) agrees to release the student’s financial aid (less any charges on the students account) directly to the student.

At the time of financial aid disbursement (after the semester add/drop date has passed), the financial aid will be applied to the student’s account. The overage of financial aid will be refunded directly to the student.

Students are strongly encouraged to sign up for Direct Deposit through the <a href="https://orgsync.com/82489/chapter">Eagle Gateway</a> in MyUMW. Otherwise, the student will automatically receive a check to their UMW campus mailbox.
<h3>Enrollment</h3>
For Fall, Spring or Academic Year programs, Financial Aid awards are based on full-time enrollment. If enrollment is decreased below full-time status (12 credits per semester), financial aid packages could also decrease.  Students are encouraged to contact the UMW Office of Financial Aid if this situation occurs. Otherwise, financial aid will be prorated when notification is received from the host school.
<h3>Summer Study Abroad Programs</h3>
Financial Aid for Summer programs may be limited based on the specific program. <a href="http://www.umw.edu/financialaid/eligibility/">Eligibility for Federal Financial Aid</a> (Direct Student or Parent Plus Loans or Pell Grant) is based on eligibility from the previous year.

Federal aid eligibility is also based on enrollment. Students must be enrolled in at least 6 credits in the summer semester. Programs must be a minimum of five weeks.

Many private educational loans can be used toward shorter study abroad experiences.  Speak to your local bank, or choose from a list of commonly used lenders at UMW.
<h3>Study Abroad Scholarships</h3>
There are a variety of <a href="http://international.umw.edu/study-abroad-2/scholarships/umwscholarships/">Study Abroad Scholarships</a> available through the Center for International Education. Many general scholarships awarded through UMW can also be used for Study Abroad. The Financial Aid adviser will determine eligibility.
