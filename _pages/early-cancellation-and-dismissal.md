<h2>Early Cancellation</h2>
Students are encouraged to provide at least two weeks notice to their supervisors if they plan to resign prior to the full term of their job assignment. When a student resigns, supervisors must complete and return a <a href="http://www.umw.edu/financialaid/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2019/02/NOTICE-OF-CANCELLATION..docx">Notice of Cancellation.</a>

Please submit these forms to the <strong>Office of Financial Aid, Lee Hall 230, ATTN: Justina Jones, Student Employment Coordinator</strong>. Signing these forms is encouraged but optional for the student.
<h2>Dismissals</h2>
A student is subject to dismissal from campus employment if the student
<ol>
 	<li>exhibits improper behavior or insufficient skills for the job assignment, or</li>
 	<li>does not report to work as scheduled.</li>
</ol>
At the discretion of the supervisor, two such incidents will result in a warning, with documentation of the incidents sent to the Student Employment Coordinator. A third incident will result in immediate dismissal from the employment position.

<strong>Note:</strong> a student is subject to immediate dismissal, <strong>with no prior warnings</strong>, from student employment if the student deliberately falsifies a timecard or deliberately violates the <a href="http://www.umw.edu/financialaid/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2016/02/Confidentiality-Agreement.pdf" rel="">Confidentiality Agreement</a>. These are considered Honor Code violations and supervisors may report such incidents to the Honor Council.

In the event of a dismissal, please submit the above forms to the Office of Financial Aid, Lee Hall 230, ATTN: Student Employment Coordinator. Signing these forms is encouraged but optional for the student.
