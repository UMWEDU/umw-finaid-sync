<h2>There are many scholarship opportunities at UMW!</h2>
<h3>Endowed UMW Foundation Scholarships and Awards (non-Departmental)</h3>
UMW Foundation Scholarships are based on endowment funds managed by the UMW Foundation. These scholarships are awarded through the <a href="http://umw.scholarships.ngwebsolutions.com/">Online Scholarship Manager</a>. Both academic merit and financial need may be factors in the selection process (based on the wishes of the scholarship donor). To receive consideration for need-based scholarships, you must <a href="https://fafsa.ed.gov/">file the FAFSA</a> in addition to competing the scholarship application.
<h3>Departmental Scholarships and Awards</h3>
Most academic departments award a variety of scholarships each year. Each Department selects recipients from students that have declared majors in their specific discipline.  Scholarship opportunities for each academic department can be applied for through the UMW <a href="http://umw.scholarships.ngwebsolutions.com/">Online Scholarship Manager</a>.
<h3>Merit Based Freshman and Transfer Student Scholarships</h3>
First- time freshmen and transfer students are automatically considered for select scholarships based on GPA/SAT/ACT scores. Scholarships are also available for incoming students that choose not to submit test scores. For more information regarding the selection process, please contact the <a href="http://www.umw.edu/admissions/meet-us/">Office of Admissions</a> and visit the <a href="http://www.umw.edu/admissions/undergraduate/checklist/firstyear-scholarships/">Admissions Merit Scholarships</a> webpage.

<h3>Washington and Alvey Programs</h3>

<h3>Scholarships from non-UMW Sources</h3>
Students can receive scholarships from non-UMW sources - high school, religious organization, etc. Along with the scholarship check, the donor should be sure to indicate the student recipient’s name and student ID number.<del></del>

Per the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division III Bylaw 15.2.3.5.1 it is not permissible for a student-athlete to receive financial aid, directly or indirectly, from a source outside the institution (e.g., a foreign government, a sports association, a high school booster club) for expenses related to attendance at a member institution, if the award of such financial aid is based in any degree upon the recipient's athletics leadership, ability, participation or performance, except as permitted in Bylaw <a href="https://web3.ncaa.org/lsdbi/bylaw?bylawId=6840">15.2.3.5</a>. Receipt of financial aid from such a source renders the student-athlete ineligible for all intercollegiate athletics participation. <em>(Revised: 8/22/06, 4/30/09)</em>
<h3>Scholarships for UMW Employee Children</h3>
Scholarships are available for UMW employee's children.  In order to be eligible for this opportunity, students will want to submit the <a href="http://umw.scholarships.ngwebsolutions.com">Online Scholarship Manager Application</a>.  For any questions regarding these scholarship opportunities, please contact the Office of Financial Aid at (540) 654-2468 or <a href="mailto:finaid@umw.edu">finaid@umw.edu</a> .
<h3>UMW General Scholarship</h3>
This need-based UMW Scholarship is awarded to students based on available funding each year. To be eligible, students must submit the FAFSA by the priority filing date each year.  Students are automatically considered based on their amount of financial need, as determined by the FAFSA. The General Scholarship may be funded by UMW or by endowed Scholarships. Because of this, students may notice that their General Scholarship has been reduced if they have been awarded an endowed foundation scholarship.
