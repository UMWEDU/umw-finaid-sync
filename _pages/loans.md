UMW administers a variety of student loan options, including Federal Direct Loans,  private educational loans, and Direct Parent Plus Loans. Before accepting a student loan, students are encouraged to research the terms and conditions of those loans. Students and families may also meet with a UMW Financial Aid representative to discuss the responsibilities of accepting student loans.
