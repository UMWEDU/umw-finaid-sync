Below you will find frequently asked questions for the upcoming academic year. This FAQ addresses questions about basic FAFSA and verification processes and deadlines, as well as additional PLUS and private loan and scholarship information. Please contact the Office of Financial Aid at (540) 654-2468 or <a href="mailto:finaid@umw.edu">finaid@umw.edu</a> if you need further information.
<h3>How do I apply for financial aid?</h3>
Complete the 2015-2016 <a href="http://FAFSA.ed.gov">Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)</a>, available after January 1, 2016. The Office of Financial Aid will then contact you through mail (first time students) or email (continuing students) regarding any additional requirements that are needed. Requirements can also be viewed through your MYUMW portal.
<h3>When do I apply for financial aid?</h3>
In order to be considered for federal, state, and institutional financial aid, you must file the FAFSA by March 1 (Freshmen or Continuing Students) or April 1 (Incoming Transfer students). If you submit the FAFSA after these dates, you may only be considered for Direct Loans and the Federal Pell Grant.
<h3>What happens after I file the FAFSA?</h3>
If you are an incoming freshman applicant, you will receive an award letter to the address listed on your FAFSA by March 16. This award letter provides the following:
<ul>
	<li>Overview of your information based on FAFSA results in the top right-hand corner.</li>
	<li>The body of the award letter breaks down your financial aid offers.</li>
	<li>If you are selected for verification, you will see a list of documents at the bottom of the letter that must be submitted to the Office of Financial Aid by July 1.</li>
	<li>Late paperwork may result in cancelled aid.</li>
</ul>
Continuing students will receive notices in April of their verification requirements via MyUMW and their UMW e-mails. Verification paperwork for continuing students is due July 1. Continuing students will be able to view their Financial Aid award through MyUMW in May.
<h3>Is the financial aid application process different for graduate students?</h3>
Graduate students must also file the FAFSA in order to be considered for federal aid. Graduate students are only eligible for the Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan. Gift aid typically comes from departmental scholarships.
<h3>When will I hear about merit scholarships?</h3>
The Office of Admissions notifies students of merit scholarship awards with admission offers. UMW Foundation Scholarships are determined in June, and added to student financial aid packages at that time.
<h3>Are there any other scholarships available?</h3>
For consideration of UMW Foundation Scholarships, submit the Scholarship Application (available through the UMW Online Scholarship Manager) by June 1. The scholarships available through this application are both merit and  need-based. All need- based scholarships require financial need demonstrated through the FAFSA. If you have declared your major, you can also check your department’s website for information about departmental scholarships.
<h3>How do I apply for a job on campus?</h3>
Students may complete the work application at any time after April 2015; however, students with demonstrated financial need (by filing the FAFSA) are considered for jobs first.
<h3>What are the costs for tuition, fees, room and board?</h3>
Actual costs are determined in late April when the Board of Visitors meets. Once the costs are known, you will receive that information in the mail.  Current costs can be found in the ‘General Information’ document on the Financial Aid Web page, or by contacting the Office of Student Accounts.
<h3>How do I apply for a student or parent loan?</h3>
Students are considered for federal loans when they apply for federal student aid via the FAFSA. In order to accept federal Direct Loans, students must complete the <a href="http://www.studentloans.gov/">Direct Loan Entrance Counseling and Master Promissory Note</a>. Students must also accept/decline all loan offers through their <a href="https://auth.umw.edu/authenticationendpoint/login.do?passiveAuth=false&amp;forceAuth=false&amp;commonAuthCallerPath=%2Fcas%2Flogin%3Bredirect%3DaHR0cHM6Ly9vcmdzeW5jLmNvbS9jYXMvdW5pdmVyc2l0eS1vZi1tYXJ5LXdhc2hpbmd0b24%3BsamlLogin%3Dfalse&amp;relyingParty=&amp;type=samlsso&amp;sessionDataKey=c78d4855-e642-40dc-94e8-643fd024aa21&amp;relyingParty=&amp;type=samlsso&amp;sp=default&amp;isSaaSApp=true&amp;authenticators=BasicAuthenticator:LOCAL">MYUMW portal</a>.

Parents may apply for the <a href="http://www.studentloans.gov">PLUS Loan</a> after June 1 each year. Once approved, parents must also complete the PLUS Master Promissory Note each year. The <a href="http://adminfinance.umw.edu/financialaid/2015-2016-information/">Direct PLUS Request Form</a> must be submitted to our office after completing the online processes.

Students may also apply for <a href="http://adminfinance.umw.edu/financialaid/2012-2013-loan-instructions-and-forms/private-loans/">private educational loans</a>.
<h3>How do I request consideration for special circumstances?</h3>
Since funds are limited, all requests for additional aid must be in the form of a formal request using the special circumstances instructions. Students may complete these requests after April 1 if they fall into one of the applicable situations. If approved, the student may be eligible for a conversion of unsubsidized loans to subsidized loans, or a Federal Pell Grant.
<h3>When is my bill due and what other options are available?</h3>
The Fall bill is usually due in late July. Payments plan information will be sent to students and parents during the Spring semester of the previous academic year. Additional questions about payment plans and coordination of prepaid plans should be directed to the Office of Student Accounts at <a href="mailto:umwbills@umw.edu">umwbills@umw.edu</a> or (540) 654-1250.
