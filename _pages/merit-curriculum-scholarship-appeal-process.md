This appeal process is for students that have not been renewed for a merit-based scholarship or curriculum award based on unmet renewal criteria.  The following awards may be affected:
<ul>
 	<li>Presidential Award</li>
 	<li>Presidential Diversity</li>
 	<li>Blue and Gray Award</li>
 	<li>Transfer Award</li>
 	<li>Eagle Award</li>
 	<li>Talon Award</li>
 	<li>Scholastic Excellence</li>
 	<li>International Award</li>
</ul>
While each of these scholarships has a unique set of renewal criteria, the most common reasons for non-renewal are not meeting GPA requirements, moving to off campus housing, not meeting enrollment criteria, etc.

Students are permitted to appeal the loss of a merit (or curriculum) based award; however, the right to appeal must be based on extraordinary, personal circumstances that contributed to the student's inability to meet the renewal requirements. Acceptable circumstances include:
<ul>
 	<li>The death of an immediate family member (i.e. mother, father, sibling, aunt, uncle, cousin, grandparent)</li>
 	<li>A serious, documented injury or illness</li>
 	<li>Significant, unanticipated family obligations due to medical issue or illness</li>
 	<li>A catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, or natural disaster that affects the student's academic attendance or performance</li>
</ul>
To appeal, students may complete the <a href="https://dynamicforms.ngwebsolutions.com/Submit/Form/Page?form=156d767b-7685-43b8-b303-c2f82f6e1e34&amp;page=152885&amp;token=rP1BP2mcFBJ4W7WsdEYsU%2BdgciQL2oh87YlXNMF2dvE%3D">Merit &amp; Curriculum Scholarship Appeal Form</a> through myUMW.

If reinstated, awards are not retroactive. The award will be reinstated for the current or upcoming semesters based on the determination made by the Scholarship committee.
